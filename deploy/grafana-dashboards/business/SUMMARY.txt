KEY FORMULAS IMPLEMENTED
================================================================================

Revenue Calculations:
- MRR Growth Rate = ((Current MRR - Previous MRR) / Previous MRR) × 100
- ARPC = MRR / Number of Customers

Customer Economics:
- CAC = (Sales + Marketing Costs) / New Customers Acquired
- LTV = ARPC / Monthly Churn Rate
- LTV:CAC Ratio = LTV / CAC
- CAC Payback Period = CAC / ARPC

Retention & Churn:
- Churn Rate = (Customers Lost / Customers at Start) × 100
- Retention Rate = 100 - Churn Rate

Engagement:
- DAU/MAU Ratio = (DAU / MAU) × 100

Conversion:
- Conversion Rate = (Conversions / Total Visitors) × 100
- Activation Rate = (Activated Users / Sign-ups) × 100
- Trial Conversion = (Paid Customers / Trial Users) × 100

Marketing:
- CPA = Marketing Spend / Acquisitions
- ROI = (Revenue - Cost) / Cost
- K-factor = Invites per User × Invite Conversion Rate
